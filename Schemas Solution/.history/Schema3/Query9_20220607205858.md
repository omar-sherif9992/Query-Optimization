## Query 9

* Find the names of sailors who have reserved both a red and a green boat.

### Original Query

```
select s.sname
from sailors s, reserves r, boat b
where
s.sid = r.sid
and
r.bid = b.bid
and
b.color = 'red'
and
s.sid in ( select s2.sid
from sailors s2, boat b2, reserves r2
where s2.sid = r2.sid
and
r2.bid = b2.bid
and
b2.color = 'red');

```

#### Result Set

* 177 Rows

##### Explanation :
  * Metrics :
   | Execution Time : 33.462 ms | Total Expected Cost : 1968.71 |
  * First , a Sequential Scan occured on boat b2 Table  to filter the  boats with color green  .
  * Second , a Hash Table was built on the run on b2 attributes cause a Hash Join  this resulted with 1024 Buckets created ,and Memory Usage of 24 KB.
  * Thirdly , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves r2 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b2's buckets to full inner join on the condition r2.bid= b2.bid .
  * Fourthly , on the intermediate results a Hash table was built on it.
  * Fifth , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves s2 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b2's buckets to full inner join on the condition s2.sid= r2.sid
  * Sixth , we repeat the process again with s1,b1,r1 and  inner join all the results together with a hash semi join  and based on the conditions

##### Explanation :
  * First , a Sequential Scan occured on Reserves Table to filter the reserved boats with bid 103 and it costs 0..627 rows,and read through 35000 Rows and 582 Rows are left after the filtration of the where condition.
  * Second , a Hash Table was built on the run on r.bid of the 582 Rows and it costed 627.50...627.50 rows,this resulted with 1024 Buckets created ,and Memory Usage of 29 KB.
  * Thirdly , a Sequential Scan occured on Sailors Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Reserves's buckets to full inner join on the condition and it costed 00..349 rows, and it read through 19000 rows.
  * Fourthly, a Hash Semi Join occurred to produce the result set of the condition of s.sid = r.sid , and the reason it is Hash Semi Join In the first query, only the r.sid needs to be saved from the reserves into the hash table, because that is the only data needed to implement the semi-join , it costs 634.77 ... 1084.60 rows.
