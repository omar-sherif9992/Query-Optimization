## Query 9

* Find the names of sailors who have reserved both a red and a green boat.

### Original Query

```
select s.sname
from sailors s, reserves r, boat b
where
s.sid = r.sid
and
r.bid = b.bid
and
b.color = 'red'
and
s.sid in ( select s2.sid
from sailors s2, boat b2, reserves r2
where s2.sid = r2.sid
and
r2.bid = b2.bid
and
b2.color = 'red');

```

#### Result Set

  * First , a Sequential Scan occured on boat b2 Table  to filter the  boats with color green  .
  * Second , a Hash Table was built on the run on b2 attributes cause a Hash Join  this resulted with 1024 Buckets created ,and Memory Usage of 24 KB .
  * Thirdly , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves r2 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b2's buckets to full inner join on the condition r2.bid= b2.bid .
  * Fourthly , on the intermediate results a Hash table was built on it.
  * Fifth , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves s2 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b2's buckets to full inner join on the condition s2.sid= r2.sid .
  * Sixth , we repeat the process again with s1,b1,r1 and  inner join all the results together with a hash semi join  and based on the conditions.

  |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * The B-tree helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .
  
  * The Query Planner used the B-tree index of b_sailorsSID index scan to on instead of Seq scan which improved the cost from 00 .. 62.5 to 0.29 .. 0.33

      | Execution Time : 33.462 ms | Total Expected Cost : 2721.55 |
      |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * Reason : 
      - a Hash Semi Join was used instead of a Hash Join which it costs less because attributes where projected 
      - 5 less steps of the Query Plan where made in the Optimized one which helped in decreasing the cost.
   
  * First , a Sequential Scan occured on boat b1 Table  to filter the  boats with color red .

  * Second , a Hash Table was built on the run on b1 attributes cause a Hash Join  this resulted with 1024 Buckets created ,and Memory Usage of 24 KB .

  * Thirdly , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves r1 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b1's buckets to full inner join on the condition r1.bid= b1.bid .
  * Fourthly , on the intermediate results a Hash table was built on it.
  * Fifth , a Sequential Scan occured on reserves s1 Table to be able to hash each row's sid to the Boat b1's buckets to full inner join on the condition s1.sid= r1.sid .
  * Sixth , we repeat the process again with s2,b2,r2 and  inner join all the results together with a hash semi join  and based on the conditions.
