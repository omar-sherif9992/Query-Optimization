where
s.sid = r.sid
and
r.bid = b.bid
and
b.color = 'red'

s.sid in ( select s2.sid
from sailors s2, boat b2, reserves r2
where s2.sid = r2.sid

         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * Flags Hashjoin and HashAgg here where disabled for future after many trials and errors , I've discovered the best way to show the difference interms of the cost and to beat the Postgres Query Optimizer Algorithm to be able to show indices effect and cost differenes .

         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * The B-tree helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .

  * The Query Planner used the B-tree index because B-Tree is O(Log n) performance with Exact Values 
  
  * Here it showed the improvement due to for every condition of Joining in the Query the Merge Join used index scan using ZigZag algorithm .

 ##### Explanation :
  * Metrics :

         | Execution Time : 12.6 ms | Total Expected Cost : 3052.12 |
         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * The Hash helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time(but in the execution time processor was overwhelmed) and Expected Cost .
  
  * The Query Planner used the Hash index because Hash is O(1) performance with Exact Values and considered the best for exact values queries.
  
  * Here it showed the improvement due to for every condition of Joining in the Query the Nested Loop Join using index scan using Hash based algorithm  which approximatly maded to be O(n) performance.
   
  * The Where clause condition on the color used Hash too.


4) given query with BRIN indices only,

  * Metrics :

         | Execution Time : 4679 ms | Total Expected Cost : 2401050935.23  |
         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * Here the BRIN was not used in the original Query Plan settings  (Hashjoin and HashAgg are off) so I've made seqscan=off too.
  
  * The Execution Time and Expected Cost became the Worst of all .
  
  * This happened because the Query Optimizer didnt used it from the place due to BRIN  Usage here was not suitable so we have used it to simulate seqscan behaviour only we traveresed it all and followed all its pointers so it is worst index to use in this case.

  * Here it showed the improvement due to for every condition of Joining in the Query the Nested Loop Join using index scan using Hash based algorithm  which approximatly maded to be O(n) performance.
   
  * The Where clause condition on the color used B-tree which is more better as colors are repetable and sorted after each other at the leaves of the b-tree with  O(Log n) performance on all at one time  little bit better than Hash O(1) but calculation of hashfunction and stored in different buckets .

##### Explanation :

  * Metrics :

         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

  * Same flags is set to all here too.
  * Reason :
      - This Query Improved in the Execution time and Expected Cost than the Original Query  from 11368.59 to 9466.30.
      - Because the loops ends faster and exits due to I used the Exist Operator instead of the In Operator so it helped in the intermediate results.
      - I have used the table Sailors once instead of twiceas used in original Query .
      - 6 less steps of the Query Plan where made in the Optimized one which helped in decreasing the cost.
