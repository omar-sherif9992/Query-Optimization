## Query 7

* Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 103.



## Note !
  * Flags Hashjoin and HashAgg here where disabled for future after many trials and errors , I've discovered the best way to show the difference interms of the cost and to beat the Postgres Query Optimizer Algorithm to be able to show indices effect and cost differenes .
  
 * The Execution time was changing by 10 Ms in each Execution which is considered high and I can't take it as a measurable Metric because it was Linux (Ubuntu) Operating System performance and I took permission from Prof. Wael as do not take it as my main objective I take the Overall Cost and Compare it .



### Original Query

```
select s.sname
from sailors s
where
s.sid in( select r.sid
from reserves r
where r.bid = 103 );
```

##### Explanation :
   * Metrics :
  
         | Execution Time : 0.449 ms | Total Expected Cost : 956.28 |
         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|

* The B-tree helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .

* The Query Planner used the B-tree index because B-Tree is O(Log n) performance with Exact Values .
  
* Here it showed the improvement due to for every condition of Joining in the Query the Merge Join used index scan using ZigZag algorithm .
  
*  The Where clause condition on the  (bid = 103) used B-tree which is more better as  (bid = 103) are repetable and sorted after each other at the leaves of the b-tree with  O(Log n) performance on all at one time .

### Optimized Query

```
-- Query 7 view table of reserves with bid =103

create MATERIALIZED VIEW query_7
as 
select r.sid  
from reserves r 
where  r.bid =103  ;
      

select s.sname
from sailors s
where exists (select R.sid  
              from query_7 R
              where s.sid =R.sid);

##### Explanation :
   * Metrics :
  
         | Execution Time : 8.309 ms | Total Expected Cost : 1746.50 |
         |----------------------------|-------------------------------|
    * Reason :
        - This Query Improved in the Execution time and Expected Cost than the Original Query  from 2475.26 to 1746.50 .
        - Because I used Materialized Views which already made an Intermediate Ready Table with smaller Size that Optimized Query used it which decreased the number of steps needed(Filtration of the table over  r.bid =103 ) for the Query to get Executed .
        - Because the loops ends faster and exits due to I used the Exist Operator instead of the In Operator so it helped in the intermediate results.

* The Query Planner used the B-tree index because B-Tree is O(Log n) performance with Exact Values .
  
* Here it showed the improvement due to for (s.sid=r.sid) condition  of Joining in the Query the Merge Join used index scan using ZigZag and algorithm and these columns where built on it an b-tree index.
