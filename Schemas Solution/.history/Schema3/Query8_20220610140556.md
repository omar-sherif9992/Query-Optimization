## Query 8

- Find the names of sailors who haue reserved a red boat .

## Note !

- Flags Hashjoin and HashAgg here where disabled for future after many trials and errors , I've discovered the best way to show the difference interms of the cost and to beat the Postgres Query Optimizer Algorithm to be able to show indices effect and cost differenes .

- The Execution time was changing by 10 Ms in each Execution which is considered high and I can't take it as a measurable Metric because it was Linux (Ubuntu) Operating System performance and I took permission from Prof. Wael as do not take it as my main objective I take the Overall Cost and Compare it .

### Original Query

select s.sname
from sailors s
where s.sid in ( select r.sid
from reserves r
where r. bid in (select b.bid
from boat b
where b.color = 'red'));
```

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 2.421 ms | Total Expected Cost : 2779.35 |
  | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

- The B-tree helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .

- The Query Planner used the B-tree index because B-Tree is O(Log n) performance for the attributes before the IN Operator cause the leaves are sorted and Query Planner sorted the subquery result to match to Merge Join on condition (b.bid=r.bid).

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 0.993 ms | Total Expected Cost : 2168.36 |
  | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

- The Hash helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .

- The Query Planner used the Hash index because Hash is O(1) performance with Exact Values and considered the best for exact values queries .

- Here it showed the improvement due to for condition of Joining in the Query the Nested Loop Semi Join using index scan using Hash based algorithm on the condition (b.bid=r.bid) which approximatly maded to be O(n) performance .
- Here it showed the improvement due to for condition of (color = "red") with performance of O(1) .

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 18733.23 ms | Total Expected Cost : 1126150803.66 |
  | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

- Here the BRIN was not used in the original Query Plan settings (Hashjoin and HashAgg are off) so I've made seqscan=off too.

- The Execution Time and Expected Cost became the Worst of all .

- This happened because the Query Optimizer didnt used it from the first place due to BRIN Usage here was not suitable so we have used it to simulate seqscan behaviour only we traveresed it all and followed all its pointers so it is worst index to use in this case.
- - Because there where no Aggregation used and was not low selectivity Query.


5. given query with mixed indices (any mix of your choice) :

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 2.486 ms | Total Expected Cost : 2373.87 |
  | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

- The Query Planner used the Merge semi join by using both the ZigZag join and the Hash based algorithm together on the condition (s.sid =r.sid) which improved the Execution time and the expected cost way more better which made the join in O(n log n) .
- - The Query Planner used the Merge semi join by using both the ZigZag join and the Hash based algorithm together on the condition (r.bid = b.bid) which improved the Execution time and the expected cost way more better which made the join in O(n log n) .

- And It used the Hash indexed scan on color ='red' with performance of O(1) .

### Optimized Query

create MATERIALIZED VIEW query_8
as
select r1.sid
 from (select  r.sid
       from reserves r
       where exists (select * from boat b where r.bid=b.bid  and color='red'  ) ) as r1 ;

explain analyze select s.sname

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 6.290 ms | Total Expected Cost : 1806.34 |
  | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

- Reason :
  - This Query Improved in the Execution time and Expected Cost than the Original Query from 5664.74 to 1806.34 .
  - Because I used Materialized Views which already made an Intermediate Ready Table with smaller Size that Optimized Query used it which decreased the number of steps needed( Filtration of the table over red boats reserve sids  ) for the Query to get Executed .
  - Because the loops ends faster and exits due to I used the Exist Operator instead of the In Operator that waits till the end.

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 1.157 ms | Total Expected Cost :191.19 |
  | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |

- The B-tree helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time and Expected Cost .

- The Query Planner used the B-tree index because B-Tree is O(Log n) performance with Exact Values .
- Here it showed the improvement due to for (s.sid=R.sid (it used the index that was built on query_8 view)) condition of Joining in the Query the Merge Semi Join used index scan using ZigZag and algorithm and these columns where built on it an b-tree index.

##### Explanation :

- Metrics :

  | Execution Time : 11.896 ms | Total Expected Cost : 721.68 |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

- The Hash helped in the performance it decreased the Execution Time(but in the execution time processor was overwhelmed) and Expected Cost .

- The Query Planner used the Hash index because Hash is O(1) performance with Exact Values and considered the best for exact values queries.

- Here it showed the improvement due to for every condition of Joining in the Query the Nested Loop Semi Join using index scan using Hash based algorithm on the condition (sid(from query_8 view)=s.sid) which approximatly maded to be O(n) performance.
